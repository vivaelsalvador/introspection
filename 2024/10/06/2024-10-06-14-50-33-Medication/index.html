        <p>This is just going to be a brief article, something of a placeholder, on why I don’t want to be bound to psychiatric medication for the rest of my life. It is in response to a discussion I got into with my mother yesterday regarding whether it’s long term use as a solution to psychologicla issues was positive or not.</p>
<p>I have actively stayed away from psychiatric medication my entire life, up until 2022, when I was in the midst of my second long depressive episode and I felt that starting to take a certain medication was one of my only remaining lifelines. I had had the bottle on me for around a month, possibly longer, and I had considered it as a last resort that whole time. I can go into details about when, where, and why I first took the medication but I don’t think this is so relevant. What is relevant is that I had a feeling any effect would be shortlived, the same way the first cup of coffee on the first day is very different than the first cup of coffee on the hundredth day.</p>
<p>The medication was Welbutrin, generic name Bupropion. It is very similar in chemical nature to a recreational drug used in Berlin to party, and also to a natural leaf they chew in Yemen as their only means of getting a buzz. I do remember vividly that the first day I took it, I remembebred what it felt like to feel good, excited, alive, for the first time in months. This was both scary and beautiful.</p>
<p>A few days later, the effects started to become less noticeable. After two weeks, I don’t believe I was feeling any different at all. I called around and got the same advice from everyone: double your dose. I remember vividly how clearly how I saw through this, how I knew that if I doubled my dose I would have much of the same feelings, and that they would slowly disappear over the following two weeks, which is exactly what happened. Ironically I wrote one of my most beautiful productions during this period, on thanksgiving, but when I was at one of my most depressed.</p>
<p>A month later, I was still taking the double dose and was in one of the lowest states of depressions I had ever felt. I almost immediately started meditating, then stopped the medication, went to Mexico a week later and spent the month meditating and doing other positive actions for my mental and physical health and recovered.</p>
<p>To this day, I do not believe in this medication for more than a short life, yet I often still get tricked into thinking it will have lasting effects. I am currently taking that same double dose, though it is coincidental, as I am more often not taking it than taking it, and this time was again ironically to protect against a major depressive episode, which I am still falling into. So actually, today I did not take it at all. I have been told I have an issue with abruptly adjusting medication, and while I agree with this sentiment, in this particular case, with this particular medication, I believe it is ok. If I start to have major symptoms from cessassion, I can begin again immediately, and it will have an effect the same day. Yesterday, and the few days before that, have been some of the worst days I’ve experienced, and I was on that same double dose, so I am attempting to clear out and remove it.</p>
<p>So much for a brief article. The above has been only one account of what I would consider the lightest medication I take, considering it’s mechanism of action (it is a noepinephrine-dopamine-reuptake-inhibtor) and the general “simplicitly” (I put this in quotes because there is nothing simple about adjusting medication) of handling immediate and short lasting withdrawal symptoms.</p>
<p>This medication is part of a small cocktail of medications I have been working with over the past nearly two years, which also includes Prozac (Fluoxetine), Klonopin (Clonazepam), Seroquel (Quetiapine), and Modafinil, among a few others to help wean me off Klonopin, neither of which proved successful, and one of which nearly drove me to suicide.</p>
<p>Sadly, as much as I’d like to continue this article to completeness, it does take a lot out of me to write all of this down and I’m afraid I hve to stop here for now for fear of overwhelming myself and sending myself into a bad psychological headspace. Fear and crippling anxiety are two things that I have to be extra attentive to these days, as they can both quickly derail my mental state without providing a recovery timeframe.</p>
